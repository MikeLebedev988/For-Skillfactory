Hi, all.
This is the game - Battleship.
Two players. Two boards with seven ships on each that you need to set up and destroy.
Set up ships on board manually or automaticaly.
Minimal distance between ships is one cell.
Choose coordinates on board which you want to shoot.
Base code of this game from webinar by Egor Zakutei in C2 module with a few exceptions:
  -renamed some attributes in the process of getting to know and assimilate the interaction of the code, which helped to make it better.
  -added option to set up ships coordinate and direction mannualy.
  -delay between moves.
  -slightly differently executed greeting and field display.
