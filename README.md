Hello. This is my first practice in programming.
Glad to present you training game called tic-tac-toe.
In which we have two players and a field where you need to put "x" or "o" with coordinates horizontally and vertically.
The player who makes up horizontally, vertically or diagonally a line of three "x" or "o" will win.
Else there will be a draw.
Thank you for this experience.
